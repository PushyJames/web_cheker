If you have already python3 versions 3.7.x or later just installed:

	check (from Windows PowerShell) you have the latest PIP version " python -m pip install --upgrade pip "

	then download and Install the Requests Module " pip install requests "

	finally double click the file "web_checker.py" and follow the instructions on PythonPowerShell:
		first - input target string
		second - input text file name with testing URLs
			(look at example: source.text)
		and - look at file truly.txt
			(target string's WEB Pages URL's are there) 


Else:

	Please install properly the latest python3 version from the web site " https://www.python.org/downloads/ ".

	check (from Windows PowerShell) you have the latest PIP	version " python -m pip install --upgrade pip "

	then download and Install the Requests Module " pip install requests "

		first - input target string
		second - input text file name with testing URLs
